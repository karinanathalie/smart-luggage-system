Flight Baggage Prediction
Predicts the total weight of passengers' luggage for a flight based on Monte Carlo simulations.

Introduction
The Flight Baggage Prediction project uses Monte Carlo simulations to predict the total weight of passengers' luggage for a flight. It simulates the expected weights of individual luggage items based on historical data and calculates the overall distribution of luggage weights.

Features
* Monte Carlo simulations for predicting luggage weights
* Histogram visualization of simulated weights
* Identification of the highest density point in the simulation
* Display of total passengers' luggage weight and excess belly capacity prediction

Requirements
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:


Usage
Run the simulation script to predict luggage weights:

The script will output the value with the highest density in the simulation and display a histogram of the predicted weights.
