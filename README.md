## Introduction

The Flight Baggage Prediction project uses Monte Carlo simulations to predict the total weight of passengers' luggage for a flight. It simulates the expected weights of individual luggage items based on historical data and calculates the overall distribution of luggage weights.

## Features

- Monte Carlo simulations for predicting luggage weights
- Histogram visualization of simulated weights
- Identification of the highest density point in the simulation
- Display of total passengers' luggage weight and excess belly capacity prediction

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python weightexcess.py
```
