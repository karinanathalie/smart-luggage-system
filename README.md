Cathay Pacific's Smart Luggage System incentivizes eco-friendly air travel by rewarding passengers who pack lighter. Cathay Pacific's Smart Luggage System integrates with online check-in, providing real-time calculations of excess luggage capacity. A dynamic dashboard tracks the environmental impact of reduced luggage weight, while collaboration with Cathay Cargo optimizes cargo space utilization. Transparent communication and engaging educational initiatives raise awareness about sustainable travel practices. With its user-friendly interface, this innovative system sets a new industry standard for responsible travel.

## Branches
### Front-End (main)
#### Description:
This is the main branch of the project, responsible for the front-end development using React.js. It involves the creation of user interfaces and interactive components for the Cathay Pacific Smart Luggage System.
#### Features:
- The development of user interfaces that seamlessly integrate with the Cathay Pacific app, offering passengers an intuitive online check-in experience
- Implementation of features allowing passengers to input data related to their baggage weight and dimensions
- Integration of the developed UI components with the existing Cathay Pacific app UI, ensuring a consistent and familiar experience for users
- Calculation and display of Asia Miles earned based on the eco-friendliness of the passenger's luggage, encouraging sustainable travel practices

### Freighter Capacity Prediction (excess_capacity)
#### Description:
The Flight Baggage Prediction project uses Monte Carlo simulations to predict the total weight of passengers' luggage for a flight. It simulates the expected weights of individual luggage items based on historical data and calculates the overall distribution of luggage weights.
#### Features:
- Monte Carlo simulations for predicting luggage weights
- Histogram visualization of simulated weights
- Identification of the highest density point in the simulation
- Display of total passengers' luggage weight and excess belly capacity prediction

### Augmented Reality Measurement (ar-measurement)
#### Description:
This branch deals with the implementation of augmented reality (AR) for measuring luggage dimensions. It enhances the user experience by providing a tool for users to measure their luggage using AR technology.
#### Features:
